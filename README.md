# CS255-System-Analysis-and-DesignCS 255: System Analysis and Design Portfolio Submission

DriverPass Project Summary
The DriverPass project was developed for Liam Driver, who wanted a system to help driving students study for their written exams and practice for road tests. The client requested a web-based platform that offered online practice tests, scheduling for driving lessons, and secure account management for both students and instructors.

What I Did Well
I believe I did particularly well in documenting functional and nonfunctional requirements with clarity. I carefully traced each requirement back to user and business needs, ensuring nothing was overlooked.

What I Would Revise
If I could revise one part of my work, I would expand the rationale for technical decisions in the system design document, especially around scalability and long-term maintenance. Adding more detail about how the system could grow with increased users would strengthen the design.

Understanding and Implementing User Needs
I interpreted user needs by analyzing the client interview and translating their goals into system requirements and features. This user-centered approach shaped the design of the practice test modules, scheduling tools, and reporting features. Considering user needs is critical because it ensures the system is functional, intuitive, and aligned with real-world expectations.

Approach to Designing Software
My approach to system design emphasizes requirement gathering, breaking down features into clear models, and validating design choices against user needs. In the future, I would continue to use object models, use cases, and data flow diagrams to guide design. I also plan to incorporate more iterative feedback, aligning with Agile principles, to ensure the design remains adaptable as requirements evolve.
